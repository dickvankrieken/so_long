This is a game that I made for my studies at Codam Coding College (42 education network). <br />
It involves a player that collects some coins and then exits the map.<br />

111111111<br />
1000C0001<br />
1C1010101<br />
1110000C1<br />
1C001C101<br />
11PE100C1<br />
111111111<br />

into this:<br />
