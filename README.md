This is a game that I made for my studies at Codam Coding College (42 education network). <br />
It involves a player that collects some coins and then exits the map.<br />
The program includes a map parser that transforms this kind of map:<br />

<pre><code>
111111111
1000C0001
1C1010101
1110000C1
1C001C101
11PE100C1
111111111
</code></pre>

into this:<br />
